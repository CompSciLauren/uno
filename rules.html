        <h4>Rule and Information:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>This is a modified game of Uno, matching color or card value</li>
            <li>Cards with value 10 are Draw 2</li>
            <li>Cards with value 11 are Reverse Play Order</li>
            <li>Cards with value 12 are Skip next Player's Turn</li>
            <li>
                Cards can be Red, Green, Blue, or Yellow. 0-9, +2, switch directions,
                and skips for each color
            </li>
            <li>
                To play a card simply enter the index of the card starting at the
                leftmost card at 0 (0, 1, 2, 3, ... )
            </li>
            <li>
                You do not have to directly call Uno, to win you simply play your
                final card
            </li>
            <li>
                If you do not have a valid card to play you must draw until you get
                one you can play
            </li>
            <li>There are no special rules in this version (e.g swap decks)</li>
            <li>Bots play by the same rules as you do</li>
            <li>Bots require some time to "think"</li>
        </ul>
