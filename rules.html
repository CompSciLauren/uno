      <h4>Rule and Information:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>This is a modified game of Uno, matching color or card value.</li>

        <li>
          Card colors can be Red, Green, Blue, or Yellow. Wildcard colors can
          choose from all 4.
        </li>

        <li>
          Card values can be 0-9, draw 2, switch directions, and skips for each
          color. Wildcards can be color choice or additionally draw 4.
        </li>

        <li>To play a card simply click on the card you wish to play.</li>

        <li>
          You must call uno BEFORE playing your second-to-last card. Failing to
          do so will result in a card penalty.
        </li>

        <li>
          If you do not have a valid card to play you must draw until you get
          one you can play.
        </li>

        <li>There are no special rules in this version (e.g swap decks).</li>

        <li>Bots play by the same rules as you do.</li>

        <li>Bots require some time to "think".</li>
      </ul>
