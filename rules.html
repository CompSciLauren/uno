    <h4>Rule and Information:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>This is a modified game of Uno, matching color or card value.</li>

      <li>
        The draw-4 cards can be stacked. This means if one player pays a draw-4, the other player can also play a draw-4
        in order to force the next player to either play a draw-4 card or draw the total number of cards from the draw-4
        cards already played. This same rule applies to the draw-2 card.
      </li>

      <li>
        You must call uno BEFORE playing your second-to-last card. Failing to
        do so will result in a card penalty.
      </li>

      <li>
        If you do not have a valid card to play you must draw until you get
        one you can play.
      </li>
